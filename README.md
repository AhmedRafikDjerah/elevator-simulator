# elevator-behaviors-simulator

This is a Java project I made in 2008 during my _Computer Science Applied to Business Management_ Master at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis.

The goal was to create several elevator strategies that could be hot-loaded in a Swing application and run simulation with these different behaviors.

Elevator strategies can be found in the [elevator-strategies](https://github.com/rymai/elevator-strategies) project.
